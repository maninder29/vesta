		<h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>

		CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.

		<h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>

		The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.

		      • Within 7 business days <br>
		We will notify the users via in-site notification <br>
		      • Within 7 business days <br>

		We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.<br>

		<h2>CAN-SPAM Act</h2>
